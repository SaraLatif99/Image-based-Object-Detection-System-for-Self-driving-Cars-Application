# Image-based-Object-Detection-System-for-Self-driving-Cars-Application
# Yolo-v1

  To run the code:
    mkdir and cd to the path of "DATA_rec/"
    run "python data_util/py" for data preparaion with train and val recfile
    cd to the src root path and run "pyton run_train.py"
  
  For the test:
    Please take a look of wild_test.ipynb and demo_test.ipynb in src first.
    
    And then run test.py which could output a json file for results and draw the bbox in image
    For real time predict, to run "pythonw real_time_object_detection" on Mac/ "python real_time_object_detection"
